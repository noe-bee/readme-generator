# Readme-Generator

## Description

- The purpose of this this challenge was to create a readme generator application. This generator would generate all sections relevant to a typical readme file such the title, description, installation and more of a project. This solves the issue of developers having to copy and paste or hardcode every detail of a readme file every time they need one for a project. What I learned from completing this project is that it is always a humbling experience to be able to know the amount of work that goes into each project that solves or facilitates an issue for users.

## Installation

- To be able to use this application, nodejs should be installed to user's machine and as well as the inquirer package.

    Nodejs : https://nodejs.org/en/
    
    Inquirer package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4

## Usage
- The way to use this application is provided through the video link below. User must simply provide answers to the questions asked from the command line to generate a new readme file.
